example scripts:
variable_name_script.sh

//naming variables, you can see this variable once you type myname
myname="Andres"

//variables need to be typed as $variablename otherwise it will only print "myname"
echo $myname  -> Andres
echo myname -> myname

//if I echo a variable that doesn't have something, it will show empty

//variables are only instanced for that terminal session, once you close the session, it's gone

//Bash understands that items inside double quotes need to be shown, 
// such as the content of the variable names, if you use single quoutes
// it will only show the string

ie. echo "Hello, my name is $myname." -> Hello, my name is Andres.
    echo 'Hello, my name is $myname.' -> Hello, my name is $myname.


//variables get saved on the script

// you can use variables to save output of a valid command such as variable=$(command)
files=$(ls)
files_pwd=$(pwd)
date=$(date)

//in linux $USER shows the current username, within your distro, there are many variables that you can use
//lowecase variables are the best practice as UPPERSCASE variable are usually environement variables
// you can find which env variables you have at your disposal by typing env on the console (works for linux and windows)
