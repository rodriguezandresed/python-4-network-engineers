The versions of the VM of GNS3 has to be the same version as the GUI on Windows for it to work!

ie: GNS3-2.2.33.1-all-in-one-regular = GNS3.VM.VMware.Workstation.2.2.33.1

All the configurations need to be done on the GNS3 Gui!

Nested Virtualization has to be enabled. (KVM) or Intel virtualization!

On Linux:

cat /etc/network/interfaces 

Allows us to see the network config of that host and you can use nano to edit it!

We can use a NAT cloud on our topology to serve as DHCP server AND provide internet connection so you can upgrade modules!
